# Introduction

This folder contains script for adding meta data to onnx models from
https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wespeaker/blob/master/docs/pretrained.md

You can use the models with metadata in sherpa-onnx.


**Caution**: You have to add model meta data to `*.onnx` since we plan
to support models from different frameworks.
